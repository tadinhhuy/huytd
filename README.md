      When I was a little kid, I was really scared of the dark. But then I came to understand, dark just means the absence of photons in the visible wavelength 400 to 700 nanometers. Then I thought, well it's really silly to be afraid of a lack of photons. Then I wasn't afraid of the dark anymore after that. - Elon Musk
